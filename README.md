# schedule_calendar

##Challenege
```
Add HTML and JavaScript code to create a day planner that actively displays the current date at the top and includes labeled text boxes for each hour of a standard work day. Each textbox should be actively color coded for whether the given hour is in the past or future of, or concurrent with, the present hour. 
The user should be able to enter text into each hourly text box, click the save button--which saves the text to the browser's local storage--and should continue to be displayed after hitting save. The saved text from a previous session should also appear upon page load.
The user should be able to change the current text by simply manually changing the text and hitting save, overwriting the previous text.
```

##Coding
```
The code written fulfills the challenge criteria without embellishment to match the provided model. Most of the CSS was provided (although it was necessary to add one or two small details. It was necessary to provide HTML elements, classes, ids, etc to create the calendar, but this was accomplished by interpreting the CSS selectors provided. Only a few extra features were required to obtain the specified formatting.
The JavaScript takes advantage of the Moment.js to get the current date and time. A comparison between the current hour provided by Moment.js with the set hours of the schedule allows for active coding of the relative time (past, present, or future). 
A loop and button function provide the affordances to save the data in the text box and display saved data upon page load.
